## NPM

  - `npm start` ‚Äî This will spawn a development server with a default port of `3000`.

  - `npm run build` ‚Äî This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.

```
npm start -- --port 1234
```

Or edit the `start` script directly:

```
vite --port 1234
```

## Adding styles

You can use CSS files with simple ES2015 `import` statements anywhere in your Javascript:

```js
import "./index.css";
```

# Purpose of each file.
When starting out a project, it's always a good idea to get an idea of the file structure.
So you should know what each file does, and the general location for where files go.

## [Vite.config.js](https://vitejs.dev/config/)
[<span style="color:lightblue">Helpful link 1</span>](https://vitejs.dev/config/) |

When running vite from the command line, Vite will automatically try to resolve a config file named vite.config.js inside project root.

## [Package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json)

This file contains information about a project's dependencies. It can also contain other metadata such as a project description, the version of the project in a particular distribution, license information and even configuration data.

This file acts as the entry into the whole website. 
When the application starts this is the first page that is loaded. This file has a line of code ```<div id=‚Äùroot‚Äù></div>```. This line is very significant since all the application components are loaded into this div.

## App.jsx

This file is like the gateway to the rest of the project. It encapsulates everything else you want and need, like other components. 

Unlike "`npm create-react-app`", with "`npm nano-react-app`" the "index.jsx" and the "app.jsx" have been combined, so that `ReactDOM.render` is now inside of `App.jsx` instead of a seperate `index.jsx` file.
